The following is our assignment for the project.

\begin{quote}
    \begin{description}
    \item[(M1)] is a neural network with topology and activation function of your choice (differentiable or not), but mandatory L1 regularization.
    
    \item[(M2)] is a standard L2 linear regression (least squares).
    
    \item[(A1)] is a standard momentum descent (heavy ball) approach applied to \textbf{(M1)}.
    
    \item[(A2)] is an algorithm of the class of deflected subgradient methods applied to \textbf{(M1)}.
    
    \item[(A3)] is a basic version of the direct linear least squares solver of your choice (normal equations, QR, or SVD) applied to \textbf{(M2)}.
    
    \end{description}
    
    \noindent No off-the-shelf solvers allowed.

\noindent We split the project, and thus the report, in two parts, each one dealing with one problem and its solving algorithms.
